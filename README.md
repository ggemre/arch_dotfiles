# arch_dotfiles

The dotfiles and other configuration info for arch setup for my own future reference.

Each package was made by others. I just configured them and wrote some usefule scripts. I will do my best to link to each component I used and to give credit.

Notes on configuration:
- rofi accents with a random color on every launch, affecting the launcher and powermenu
- screensaver is set to a random color on every launch
- tty-clock is set to a random color when launched with "clock" alias
- fish uses the [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) prompt

Custom screensaver (using [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix)). Can be called from commandline or from powermenu (rofi):

### Polybar and Rofi config:

For polybar - inspired by [polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes), specifically the [forest](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes#Forest) theme, of which I borrowed a lot of modules from to create my "gruvbar" bar.

For rofi - ideas, scripts, and features taken from both this [rofi theme collection](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) and from this [setup here](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes).

### Fonts:

The kitty terminal was chosen for ligature support, (project originally used alacritty). Main font is [fira code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Nerd font icons are used.

- [FiraCode](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (for everything, I always set to "semibold")
- [Microsoft fonts](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-ms-fonts) (for Brave)
- [Noto fonts](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-fonts) (for emojis :smile:)
